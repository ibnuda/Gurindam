# Gurindam

it's an [arisu](https://github.com/FateNozomi/arisu-pcb)-style keyboard that uses
a promicro as the controller.

## About the name
[Gurindam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurindam) (Jawi: ڬوريندام) is a type of
irregular verse forms of traditional Indonesian and Malay poetry.
It is a combination of two clauses where the relative clause forms a line and is
thus linked to the second line, or the main clause.
Each pair of lines (stanza) provides complete ideas within the pair and has the
same rhyme in its end.
There is no limit on the number words per line and neither the rhythm per line is fixed.

## About the silks

The silk is Gurindam Dua Belas (Twelve Gurindam) of [Raja Ali Haji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raja_Ali_Haji) written in 1847.

## My plea
If somehow you fabricate this design, I hope that you feed a filling meal to one
of you less-fortunate neighbours.
